# Hip Cartilage Labrum Segmentation

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/896065736.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14316889)

Welcome to the **Hip Cartilage Labrum Segmentation** repository! This project provides code for preprocessing, training, and evaluation of hip cartilage and labrum segmentation using MP2RAGE and TRUFI MR images. It leverages the powerful [nnU-Net](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet/tree/v1.7.1) framework.

## Reference Framework

This work is based on nnU-Net, a self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation:
